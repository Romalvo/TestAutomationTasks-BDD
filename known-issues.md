# Known Issues and Assumptions

## Difficulties
### 1. Burger Menu Issue (Mobile Version)
- **Problem**: During tests, Cypress sometimes clicks the burger menu multiple times, causing it to fail to display as expected.
- **Solution**: Ensure the menu is fully visible and open before proceeding with the test.

### 2. Webpage Not Responding (Mobile Version)
- **Problem**: The webpage occasionally becomes unresponsive, causing tests to fail due to lack of progress.
- **Solution**: Investigate potential timeouts or network conditions that may be impacting page load.

### 3. Game Frame Loading Issue (Desktop Version)
- **Problem**: Occasionally, the game frame doesnâ€™t load correctly, leading to test failure. However, re-running the test resolves the issue.
- **Solution**: Consider adding more explicit waits or improving the test's synchronization.

## Assumptions
### 1. Technology Complexity
- The project uses BDD with a complex tech stack. It's assumed that the technology stack might present challenges, and we need to be adaptable.

### 2. Problem-Solving Mindset
- It's assumed that there will always be problems during testing, but finding solutions and adapting will be part of the process.
